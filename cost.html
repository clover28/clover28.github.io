        <h4>The Untrackable Cost</h4>
            <p class="medium">CV1.0 was a software enabled service company running college application guidance programs for high school students. The service is a structured curriculum administered by a human advisor, and the software is used for generating students’ application plans based on data and proprietary algorithms. 
              In order to start the program, the student needs to sign up for the web-based software platform, enter some information, and get paired with a human advisor. We call this process before the first meeting between the student and advisor onboarding.
              .</p>
            <p class="medium">Advisors are paid by hours and they log hours in our online system. However, the existing order and compensation system made it difficult to attribute the hours logged to the specific client, order, or type of work; it also made it easy to conflate hours. As a result, the business was facing excessively high cost that’s hard to track down. </p>

            <h4>My Dual Role</h4>
            <p class="strong medium">Leadership</p>
            <p class="medium">The existing onboarding process takes longer than promised. Students need to wait a long time before knowing who their advisor is and having their first meeting. For high school students and their parents who are under the stress of college applications, this is especially frustrating. Bad first impression from onboarding hurts the business with customer service issues, escalations, and cancellations.
               </p>
            <p class="strong medium">Prioritizing stakeholder requirements</p>
            <p class="medium">The compensation logging system impacts many departments in the business including finance, operations, sales, and product. Throughout the whole project, I led stakeholder meetings at each iteration. I ensured that the final solution solves the right problems for stakeholders and is also properly communicated to those who will be impacted. </p>

        <p class="subtitle">The Problem</p>
        <h4>The Interplay Between Two Systems </h4>
        <p class="medium">Together with a new designer, I started by gaining context of the problem through interviewing advisors and stakeholders from operations and finances. 
        </p>
        <p class="medium">It turns out that the problem with untrackable cost is two-fold: On the one hand, when advisors log the work they do out of client meetings (which are automatically logged through the meeting scheduling system on platform), they didn’t need to enter the client or the program for which the work was done. On the other hand, the system that stores client and contract information is missing the concept of program and maximum time, so it doesn’t calculate the total time spent per client per program, making it impossible to calculate the average cost of goods sold (COGS) for each program.
        </p>
        <p class="medium">To solve this problem, both the<span class="strong">compensation logging system used by advisors</span> and the <span class="strong">contract system used by admins from operations and finances</span> need to be updated.</p>

         <!-- <p class="subtitle">Success Metrics</p> -->
        <h4>Advisor Compensation Logging Experience</h4>
        <p class="medium">At the onset of the project, I set onboarding and empowering the new designer as soon as possible as one of my goals. I took several action items that allowed her to become familiar with the product and process and execute the advisor compensation logging system design on her own quickly. Specifically, I reflected on what helped me get started and did the following:
          </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Daily sync at the first two weeks to answer any questions and share contexts as much as possible
            </li>
          <li>Initiate design work planning and set the general timeline and work item            </li>
          <li>In-depth product demos to make sure the new designer become an expert on the system</li>
          <li>Onboard the new designer to our Sketch component library and design processes            </li>
          <li>Schedule regular design reviews to give feedback and ensure that the project is on track    </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="medium">We conducted user interviews together and identified many pain points in the current system from the user perspective. I prioritized the pain points we need to solve together with the business requirement to track COGS. After that, I’m proud to say that our new designer took it away.   </p>
      </div>

      <span class="anchor" id="solution"></span>
      <div class="mt80"> 
        <p class="subtitle">Part II</p>
        <h4>Admin contract system</h4>
        <p class="medium">Because this part of the project requires much more business context and rapport with stakeholders, it’s less suitable for onboarding a new designer and enable quick wins. Therefore I worked on this on my own. </p>
        <p class="medium">My approach is to involve the stakeholders early and at each important iterations of the design with face-to-face design walkthroughs and synchronous feedback, because stakeholders are too busy to comment on design file details and share contexts asynchronously. 
          </p>
        <p class="medium">To recap the problem, from the business side, we needed to rework the infrastructure for storing contract information so that it takes in the essential information that will allow us to track COGS correctly. The majority of this infrastructure was already designed by the tech lead and product manager, but it was living in the form of 10s of pages of confluence docs and glossaries, and felt like tangled yarn that needed to be untangled and translated into human-facing interfaces. So the first thing I did was to map out the use cases for the admin interface in the simplest way possible.</p>
       <!-- <div class="row full-width-sm">

              </div>
        </div>   -->
        <p class="medium">After this passed review from tech lead and product lead, it was time to translate it into interfaces. After considering the implementation cost and the switching cost for admin users whose job was to interact with them, I decided to maintain the current UI elements as much as possible, while incorporating the new data points and improving the usability. With these principles in mind, I went through several iterations of the interface with stakeholders to make sure it addresses every party’s needs and does not require any net new UI elements.
          </p>
        <p class="medium">The following is an example wireframe where the structure of a client having multiple contracts and each contract having multiple programs is addressed with the UI structure of the program data tables being contained in contract cards. (The wireframe is modified for portfolio purpose and doesn’t contain any real data.)

              </div>
        </div> 
        <p class="medium">For efficient implementation, I created detailed, annotated designs and discussed various UI options with engineers.</p>
        <p class="medium">The following are two UI options: One that's more streamlined by more effort to implement, and another that's less effort to implement. I frequently use mockups like this to help the team make decisions.</p>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p class="medium">This project went through a waterfall approach where the backend infrastructure was designed first and handed over to design, and the design was done and handed over for implementation. The end result was that the implementation scope became bigger than expected due to complications in the legacy system, and we didn’t build the most of what was designed. Although I was satisfied with the design execution and the onboarding of a new designer, I realized that design being good on its own is not going to make the best business impact. Things like this get me really interested in continuing as a product designer, where design works very closely with other functions on the product team and solve problems together.
