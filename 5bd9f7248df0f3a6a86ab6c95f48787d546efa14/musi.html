            <p>Practice is a critical part of classical musicians' life. Solo practice is an important way for musicians to improve their technique and reflect on their performance, but that time alone can lead to frustration and discouragement. Group rehearsal, provides musicians with support and motivation, but is hard to coordinate. We seek a solution that helps classical musicians practice, reflect, and coordinate with peers at ease â€“ with only one foot.</p>

          <h4>Formative Study</h4>
            <p class="medium strong">Observation and Interviews</p>
            <p class="medium">We began our formative study by conducting 2-hour observations of the music practice wing at the Earl V. Moore building and interviews with music students. We then conducted 2 structured interviews with an expert in music technology and a graduate student who plays violin. This preliminary study led us to develop several key design questions:</p>
            <ul class="medium">
              <li>How can we augment practice spaces to support proper technique when instructors are not present?</li>
              <li>How can we increase access to the world of classical music for under-served groups?</li>
              <li>How can we foster dialog between performers and audiences in an engaging way for both parties?</li>
              <li>How can we connect individuals to increase motivation and develop a sense of community?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="medium strong">Cultural Probe</p>
            <p class="medium">Using our key design questions as a guide, we used the method of cultural probes to better understand the values, attitudes, and emotions musicians have towards technological innovations in music. We provided sketch books with instructions as probe prompts to 3 undergraduate music majors. Participants had 5 days to complete the activities at their leisure. Upon collection of the journals, we conducted short debriefing interviews.</p>

            <p class="medium strong margin-top-20">Data Analysis and Insights</p>
            <p class="medium">We created an affinity diagram to derive the key insights from our observation, interviews, and cultural probes.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="medium">We found that:</p>
              <ul class="medium">
                <li>Classical musicians value their existing culture, practices, and boundaries, and dreamed up subtle ways to strengthen their bonds with their musical community instead of radical technological transformations</li>
                <li>Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators are important for musicians to persevere through their daily solo practices</li>
                <li>Musicians who play with their hands expressed a desire to use their feet to play a secondary instrument</li>

        <div class="mt80">
            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p class="medium">Based on our research insights, we individually sketched 14 concepts and narrowed them down by <strong>acceptability in the classical musician community</strong>, <strong>level of impact</strong>, and <strong>unobtrusiveness</strong>. The mat idea I sketched was selected and turned into our final product</p>
            <div class="row full-width-sm">

            </div>
            <p class="medium strong">User Enactments</p>
            <p class="medium">We took this concept back to our target users in the form of user enactments to validate our assumptions and generate more concrete design ideas. We used cardboard and paper to create the mat and buttons. We designed a test script containing 5 different scenarios to obtain user feedback on individual use, group use, and different types of button feedback.</p>
            <p class="medium">We set up our prototype materials in a music practice room and recruited music students passing by (with &#x1F36A; as incentives). Participants engaged in the enactments individually, with team members taking turns as moderator, note taker, and photographer. Participants were asked to manipulate the prototypes for comfort and ease of interaction: they could adjust the matâ€™s placement, select buttons they found appropriate for the scenario, and then place the buttons on the mat where they liked.</p>
            <div class="row full-width-sm">
              <div class="col-sm-6 mt20 mb0"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/musi_participant.png"></div>
              <div class="col-sm-6 mt20 mb0"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/musi_ue.png"></div>
            </div>
            <p class="medium">We derived the following insights from user enactments that informed our final design:</p>
            <ul class="medium">
              <li>Different instruments have different design requirements due to size, shape and positioning</li>
              <li>Participants tend to tap their feet while playing to keep rhythm, and don't want this foot tapping sound to get recorded</li>
              <li>Participants tend to use just one foot to tap the buttons</li>
              <li>Metronomes are important tools when practicing complex rhythms</li>
              <li>Participants want to control and play multiple parts at once, particularly of instruments in their own section so they can hear how they harmonize</li>
              <li>Participants said they would find the process of organizing and reviewing large batches of tracks more manageable on different device, like their phone or laptop, while the mat would be more useful for operating functions that more immediately support them as they play</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="medium">Based on these findings, we decreased the size of our mat and added a screen/speaker part to display sound wave information and deliver high-quality sound. I created a story board for the refined design:</p>

            <h4>Prototyping</h4>
            <p class="medium strong">Look and Feel</p>
            <p class="medium">I was responsible for the look and feel of the physical product. I sketched a series of different fold-able structures and created mood boards to explore different aesthetic directions. Since the classical musician community highly value traditions, we went with a vintage inspired look with wooden texture.</p>
            <div class="col-sm-12"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/musi_look_sketch.png"></div>
            <p class="medium">We iterated on the appearance of the product with 3D models. We laser cut the wooden part of the prototype and used vinyl fabric and cupboard liners to make the mat part.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="medium strong">Backend</p>
            <p class="medium">We used a laptop to act as our primary computation and recording device. We used Waveform Playlist, an open source audio recording tool, to support our recording and playback features as well as to visualize the audio waveforms. We mirrored this graphical user interface onto an iPad, which we placed onto the prototype prism as a way of demonstrating implementation of the Musi screen. We used a Particle Photon to prototype the buttons on the physical device.</p>

            </div>
           <p class="medium strong">Companion App</p>
           <p class="medium">I prototyped the companion mobile app using Sketch and InVision. Users can interact with the app prototype to experience the full use scenario, but actual syncing of tracks requires the laptop to load playable tracks onto the physical prototypeâ€™s GUI.</p>

            <h4>User Testing</h4>
            <p class="medium">We tested our design in two contexts. We set up our working prototype in a music practice room and invited music students passing by to record and playback tracks. We also invited attendees at a university design exposition to use our prototype. We were able to identify areas to drive future design work and help us realize an ideal concept.</p>
            <div class="row full-width-sm">
              <div class="col-sm-6 mt20 mb0"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/musi_cello.jpg"></div>

              <div class="col-sm-12"><p class="caption">Left: A cello student using our prototype; right: Me showing an attendee how to use the prototype</p></div>
            </div>
            <p class="medium">We reflected on the following aspects after testing the prototype with users:</p>
            <ul class="medium">
              <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Throughout our design process, we had considered how we could create a physical device flexible enough to meet the needs of differently sized and shaped instruments. We were pleased to find that whether recording with voice or a large instrument like a cello, Musi was flexible enough for users to adapt it to their ideal positioning without sacrificing their technique and posture.</li>
              <li><strong>Sound quality</strong>: While we do not intend for Musi to compete in the high quality audio recording equipment market, it is still important for Musi to record and playback tracks clearly. We used a laptop's internal microphone and external Bluetooth speakers to demonstrate Musi's recording and playback features. We found that while this setup recorded one track cleanly, when participants recorded a second track over top, they easily maxed out the gain in the recordings, leading to unwanted distortion. Higher quality speakers and microphones would benefit Musi, but even more important is the opportunity to automatically adjust sound input settings. </li>
              <li><strong>Visual Feedback</strong>: Musi's buttons provide an audible click when pressed. However, our current system interface is lacking in visual feedback on the system status: e.g. when the system has started or stopped recording. Additionally, while participants were able to quickly learn how buttons were mapped on the device, the device lacks icons or text indicating the function of each button. More visual cues is needed to enable users to use the system with minimum external instructions.</li>
            </ul>

          <h4>Next Steps</h4>
