Among the jobs-to-be-done, building a list of colleges to apply to is one of the most important ones. My team was tasked with creating a state-of-the-art solution for this job.</p><h2 id="3b87bb60-57c9-4410-ab98-366100654328" class="">Weekly build-measure-learn cycles</h2><p id="acacfad2-cf76-4537-8d0a-af163a74ce04" class="">Because we were starting from the ground up, the team were working in full build-measure-learn mode, shipping new experiments and improvements on a weekly basis. I frequently brainstormed with my team, made roadmap suggestions, designed in very short turn-around time (2‚Äì4 days), and monitored results through usage data, screen recordings, NPS score, and user conversations. However, when it is appropriate for the project, I never hesitated to advocate for more user research and user testing to de-risk our decisions.</p><h2 id="aace3fa8-9737-4c68-abf9-303bfb333c9a" class="">North-star: Retention</h2><p id="3b94384f-54d3-4863-9484-a450f28cbcf1" class="">Since the top priority was to prove the value of the guidance platform, retention was our north star.

Together with the product manager, I interviewed over 20 students and collected their real college lists. I analyzed qualitative data with affinity diagramming and painted a clear picture of the current college search process:</p><h2 id="f99df182-f35d-4b20-9cfc-b0f3fca57ead" class=""><strong>Big picture</strong></h2><p id="4db88407-7340-41b3-9c66-fd01b9cba8e8" class="">Students usually need to find 20‚Äì30 colleges and narrow the list down to the 10‚Äì15 they eventually would apply to. Because there are over 5000 colleges in the US and multitude of factors to consider, this process involves significant research and iteration.</p><h2 id="5faee9ca-cee3-4fca-b151-68fa6ce27ff8" class=""><strong>Tools</strong></h2><p id="8cd285a7-87f1-4d78-9261-c607a3482811" class="">Most students do online search and use spreadsheets.

I also defined a scalable UI system for the filters, making it easy to add in new ones. <strong>When we added 20 more filterable data points in , average meaningful actions per user grew by 25%. This showed ‚Äúall data in one place‚Äù was working and that the large number of filters were still easy enough to use.</strong></p></div></div><h3 id="8909c1ad-1191-432b-b98a-644893e84313" class="">Align the team with user insights</h3><p id="69a0d99f-4fae-4bce-80aa-3b0f1e38769f" class="">One conflict between product and engineering was whether and when we should add majors in the filter. Adding in major data has been pushed off because it would take weeks, if not months. However, based on the user interviews, I was confident that majors is an essential part in college search and a must-have for our retention goal. Eventually, the team was convinced by the user insight and decided to spend the time to collect the data.</p><p id="7bfa4854-dc8c-4633-8b95-6d2814bdd1f4" class="">I also convinced the engineers to create a custom UI for the major filter because we found that searching for colleges by major is more complex than we imagined. Students can be undecided between several majors and looking for colleges that have one of these majors, or they may want to enter a college with all of these majors so that they can decide later. They can also be looking to double major at one college. Knowing the different use cases, I created a solution that allows students to search for colleges with multiple majors. Students can also switch between ‚Äúand‚Äù and ‚Äúor‚Äù logic.</p><p id="74b93261-80ea-48d2-a761-76b87175021e" class=""><strong>When we added the major filter in, average meaningful actions per user went up; NPS scores and retention also went up significantly for this cohort.</strong></p><figure id="c4310b3e-3aa0-49bf-bf39-e056a14c2f4e" class="image"><a href="College%20Hub%20658492e026bf4ec6b4efd14617115130/major.gif"><img style="width:439px" src="College%20Hub%20658492e026bf4ec6b4efd14617115130/major.gif"/></a></figure><p id="170fc32f-14f1-4cc9-a1fa-dfc1062547e1" class="">

I considered 2 interaction models: in-table and modal. We moved forward with a 1-modal approach because: 1) It allows users to organize multiple data points more easily; 2) It takes less time to build because we have all the existing UI components.</p><figure id="7affc775-857b-4e22-9062-ba436af4843a" class="image"><a href="College Hub 658492e026bf4ec6b4efd14617115130/customize2.png"><img style="width:1366px" src="College Hub 658492e026bf4ec6b4efd14617115130/customize2.png"/></a></figure><hr><h1 id="50d6a90b-9f30-4c43-95c5-dbafe822bbe4" class="">Impact</h1><p id="bc0301c1-d9b4-4059-83e1-176cddcfd7c6" class="">Users who used College Hub had a much higher retention rate than platform users who did not use this feature.

We conducted usability tests on the live site with users, and found that it was hard for users to discover the button and hard for them to guess correctly what the button does. However, they were very excited when shown this capability. </p><p id="b0b8fdfd-37d2-4a6e-a602-fec44cb57cce" class="">This showed that: </p><ol type="1" id="2bdd1cff-739b-42eb-9043-20ded1b2790c" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>The button is not prominent enough visually.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="ef6ed02a-2231-424b-96aa-279e58eb24cc" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>The copy is not clear enough.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="29bd6920-ce2a-44bd-83f4-e943715d7652" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li>There can be more onboarding effort.

To aid the discoverability of more information, I added horizontal scroll arrows and a shadow to indicate the continuity of space.</p><figure id="af1de387-3f62-4640-a3e9-ca531ea753fb" class="image"><a href="College%20Hub%20658492e026bf4ec6b4efd14617115130/arrow.gif"><img style="width:318px" src="College%20Hub%20658492e026bf4ec6b4efd14617115130/arrow.gif"/></a></figure><p id="3c93984c-8fda-4a05-ab54-fd31a00c9c92" class="">

Mobile still was not a priority years after, since the ratio of desktop users remained much higher than mobile. Part of the reason was the nature of college application as a serious task. However, I was certain that we were losing mobile usage simply due to the poor experience on mobile.</p><p id="aebe5146-b403-4b54-a89f-a70bec65e71a" class="">Fortunately, we had some downtime between roadmap items and the team agreed it was a perfect time to squeeze in some mobile UX improvements. The challenge was how to organize the many features we have in a much tighter space.</p><p id="4c6675cf-1b28-4574-83dd-b9f335e82df3" class="">I approached this challenge mainly from two dimensions: information hierarchy and familiar patterns. First I listed all the elements on the page from the most important to the least. Then I conducted UI research to see how other ‚Äúsearch‚Äù products organize their features. </p><div id="b5a348bf-595f-4f2f-82ea-4fa6f03e6321" class="column-list"><div id="b9f119bf-e10e-4eec-b26f-3fd4610617d7" style="width:56.25%" class="column"><figure id="831c1a44-431c-4e1b-a9af-cb43acf68e70" class="image"><a href="College%20Hub%20658492e026bf4ec6b4efd14617115130/mobile_exploration.png"><img style="width:384px" src="College%20Hub%20658492e026bf4ec6b4efd14617115130/mobile_exploration.png"/></a></figure></div><div id="c72ce31f-1d00-4784-9d9b-615478c932ad" style="width:43.74999999999999%" class="column"><p id="406c77cf-83c3-4b8d-9f3e-4a907102e5b7" class="">I explored a number of solutions with different UI components and arrangements.

Even though sorting and filtering are at the bottom,  they are in a familiar pattern that users can quickly recognize.</p><p id="3419004d-9011-451b-9267-1a511e8a3c81" class="">
