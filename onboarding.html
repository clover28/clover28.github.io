        <h4>The service and the current onboarding</h4>
            <p class="medium">CV1.0 was a software enabled service company running college application guidance programs for <strong>high school students</strong>. The service is a structured curriculum administered by <strong>a human advisor</strong>, and the software is used for generating students’ application plans based on data and proprietary algorithms. 
              In order to start the program, the student needs to sign up for the web-based software platform, enter some information, and get paired with a human advisor by <strong>the operations team</strong>. We call this process before the first meeting between the student and advisor onboarding.</p>

            <h4>Clients waited too long</h4>
            <p class="medium">The existing onboarding process takes longer than promised. Students need to wait a long time before knowing who their advisor is and having their first meeting. For high school students and their parents who are under the stress of college applications, this is especially frustrating. Bad first impression from onboarding hurts the business with customer service issues, escalations, and cancellations.

        <p class="subtitle">Diagonosing the Current Situation</p>
        <h4>Interviewing the operations team</h4>
        <p class="medium">To find out why the current onboarding process is taking so long, I started off by interviewing the operations team at the company – the folks who conduct the process every day and knows the problem the best. I conducted whiteboarding sessions with three operational managers from our three different program. Together we mapped out the current end-to-end workflow from a client signing the contract to the first time they meet with an advisor, and identified pain points along the way.
        </p>
        <p class="medium">It turns out that each stage of the onboarding process has different problems that contribute to the delay:
        </p>
        <ol class="counter">
            <li>
              <p class="medium">Sales/operation data integration is error prone</p>
              <p>Sometimes client contract data can be missing during the process of being transmitted from the sales forms to the tools used by operations, which means sometimes operation doesn’t even know that there is a new client that needs to be paired with an advisor
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="medium">Information needed to pair an advisor with a student is scattered across many different tools, making the manual pairing process complicated</p>
              <p>To match a student with an advisor, folks at operations need to know about the advisor’s availability, their time zones, and if the student has any special requirements for genders or backgrounds. Astonishingly, these pieces of information are stored across eight different tools, making the pairing process unscalable.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="medium">After the student and advisor are being paired in the system, there is no automated notifications or instructions for scheduling the first meeting</p>
              <p>Once being paired with a new student, the advisor needs to manually send the student a self-introduction email and figure out a time for the first meeting by emailing back and forth. A lot of delays can happen in this process because neither the advisor (who is a college student) nor the students (who are still in high school) check their emails all the time.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="medium">Clients wait in a black box</p>
              <p>On the client side, not only is their wait time long, but they also have no visibility into this critical part of their program. Waiting with no sense of control is very anxiety-inducing for clients.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

      <div class="mt80">    
         <!-- <p class="subtitle">Success Metrics</p> -->
        <h4>Success Metrics</h4>
        <p class="medium">Through interviewing operations, I also identified the current time to first value (time from signing the contract to meet with an advisor) as a baseline for future comparisons. It turns out that it takes 3-5 days on average for the student to be paired, and another 9 days from being paired to scheduling the first meeting successfully. This was a big bottle neck for the business to increase customer satisfaction and decrease de-bookings.</p>
        <p class="medium">Because time to first value is so important for the business, we set our success metrics as “95% of users can schedule first session within 48 hours of payment”. </p>
      </div>

      <span class="anchor" id="solution"></span>
      <div class="mt80"> 
        <h4>Solution Exploration</h4>
        <p class="medium">This is an iterative process with the operations team, who is both an important stakeholder and also one of the end users, and the engineering team who delivers the final product.  </p>
        <p class="strong medium">Make it simple and scalable</p>
        <p class="medium">Since the sales operations integration problem is technical, I focused on the other areas of problem on the design side:</p> 
        <ol class="counter">
          <li>
            <p class="medium">Information needed to pair an advisor with a student is scattered across many different tools, making the manual pairing process complicated </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="medium">After the student and advisor are being paired in the system, there is no automated notifications or instructions for scheduling the first meeting </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="medium">Clients wait in a black box</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="medium">Based on the problem and the goal of solving time to first value, I defined several design goals to guide my ideation process:</p>
        <ol class="medium">
          <li>Scattered data needs to be centralized</li>
          <li>The process should be as automated as possible so that the operational cost can be lowered and the efficiency can be increased</li>  
          <li>Clients should be informed and guided throughout the process</li> 
          <li>Clients should have a sense of agency and feel confident starting the program</li> 
        </ol>
        <p class="medium">To solve for the (1), I collaborated with the operations team and got a prioritized list of data points that are needed for pairing. Because the client and the advisor need to meet on a regular cadence through several months, availability and time zone are the most important hard requirements. After that, students and their parents are most likely to have specific gender requirements. Lastly, students may have specific requirements for advisors, but our staffing resources are limited and can’t account for all special requirements. Therefore we need to convey to students that our advisors went through the same training and are equally qualified to deliver the service.</p>
        <p class="medium">To solve for (2)(3)(4), instead of putting a black box in front of clients, I decided to let them take charge and select their own advisors. With the availability and timezone data collected in (1), not only can students be automatically matched with advisors who have overlapping availabilities, but they can also go ahead and select a time slot from the advisor’s availability for their first meeting right after pairing themselves with an advisor. </p>
      <p class="strong medium">Designing a system that ties together three distinct user groups</p>
      <p class="medium">Because the business is a unique combination of service and software, the web-based software system has three distinct groups of users – students (clients), advisors, and the operations team that manages the interaction between students and advisors. 
        For clients, they need a simple yet effective way to understand what they need to do and who they can choose to pair with. For advisors, they have a way to enter availabilities but other data is missing and there’s no reminding mechanisms. For operations, they need visibility into clients’ onboarding progress and make sure advisors enter the required data. 
        To make sure the design accounts for the whole system and the three user groups working together, I got inspiration from service blueprints and mapped the whole system with client experience on the top level, and the underlying operations below.

      <p class="strong medium">Making trade-offs</p>
      <p class="medium">As soon as I got this first draft of the workflow done, I started showing it to the engineering leads for the project. I quickly found out that given the current resources and business needs, it was not realistic to add additional data points in the system. We need to work with what’s already there, availability and timezone, and make the experience work around it. For example, instead of having advisors’ majors and other background information as individual data points that can be used for matching, we decided to utilize the existing biography field and standardize the advisor biographies so that they reflect similar information. For special requests and less common use cases such as upgrading to more programs, the operations team will be notified and will continue handling them manually.</p>
      <p class="medium">In collaboration with engineering, we went through several iterations of a much more scoped-down and specific flow.</p>

        <h4>Visual Design and User Testing</h4>
        <p class="medium">When making the visual design, I utilized our existing UI components and interaction patterns as much as possible and went through a few iterations with internal feedback from stakeholders and advisors first. Then I tested a click-through prototype with student users to make sure any usability issues are addressed prior to implementation. I also designed the full email notification flow for the system.</p>
        <p class="medium">To ensure successful delivery, I collaborated closely with engineering throughout the implementation process to clarify any ambiguities and conduct QA on Github pull requests.</p>

        <h4>Tracking user behavior post-launch</h4>
        <p class="medium">One thing I learned over past projects is that it is important to track data post-launch so that the team can 1) learn and iterate and 2) measure the effect of the release. As the designer, I was particularly interested in learning whether the user behaviors were as expected and time to first value for those users who go through the new onboarding process. To measure user behavior, I set up and analyzed screen recording and heat maps in Hotjar. Through monitoring user behavior, I identified improvements to be made in the future including more information in bios and improvements on mobile.  </p>
        <p class="medium">In the end, the business decided to only roll it out to the smallest program we had (less than 10% of total clients), so we didn’t reach the ambitious metrics of “95% of users can schedule first session within 48 hours of payment”. But within the program we piloted in, we reached this goal.</p>

    <span class="anchor" id="reflection"></span> 
    <div class="mt80">    
      <h4>Reflection and learnings</h4>
      <p class="medium">In the end, I was satisfied with how the feature turned out and how users interacted with it, but looking back it was particularly obvious that I should have involved engineering in the discovery and solution exploration process      </p>
      <p class="medium">I started showing design proposals to engineering as soon as I finished discovery and made the first draft, but that felt surprising to engineers, since they were involved in neither the discovery process nor the solution brainstorming. Over time, I have learned from both practice and from the book Inspired that the more contexts engineers have, the more efficient development will be, as engineers are excellent problem solvers and the most familiar with the cost in building. It’s never too early to bring engineers in.
